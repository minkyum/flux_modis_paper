This repo contains the source code and some data used to reproduce the paper--Observations of Satellite Land Surface Phenology Indicate That Maximum Leaf Greenness Is More Associated With Global Vegetation Productivity Than Growing Season Length.

Note that the data in the "Data" folder are no longer in their raw format, however, we do not provide the raw data as 1) all data used can be downloaded online and we do not redistribute these data; 2) Github does not allow uploading big files while some raw data are very big. However, this repository does not contain all the code scripts used to process the raw data as it would be hard for anyone to run the code without having the real data, and we do provide detailed data processing steps in the paper. So, we only include critical formatted data used to fit the models and make the figures in this repository. Anyone interested in implementing our data processing steps is welcome to contact us through an email.

*If there are any problems running the code scripts, please leave an issue or send us an email.*
